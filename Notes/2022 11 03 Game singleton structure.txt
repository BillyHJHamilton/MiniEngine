Structure

GameProgram - Lifetime from the moment the game starts up until it shuts down
 (Game; GameWindow; GameProgram; App; GameEngine; GameInstance; ...)
 - Loading assets
 - Initializing permanent global data (prefabs, etc)
  - Though in a larger game some things cd be loaded on a per-level basis
 - Manage system resources like input/output.

GameSession - Lifetime from when you hit "new game" or "load game" until you return to main menu
 - Wouldn't include the shell menu (Would you be in any session at that time?  Perhaps a temp one?)
 - Persists between levels
 - Singletons at this level for player's save data (score, lives, story progress, etc)
 - (Technically, a "Session" is not quite the same as a "Playthrough", since you load and save to restore the same "Playthrough" in multiple "Sessions"... but from the app perspective, a Session is about playing a single player's game continuously)
 - Could be that a session is optional to have (so you don't need one on the menu)
  - Or it could be that a session is necessary to have, but you can kill it and load a new one at any time.

GameProgram - a true singleton
 - Program Systems - app level singletons
  - Asset manager, for instance
 - Current World
  - Objects
  - WorldSystems
 - Current Session

GameSettings
 - We think of these as persisting between runtimes
  - Settings could be at the app level
  - Or they could be with the user's save file

GameMaker doesn't have any sense of the GameSession.
- Although it has the "restart game" command.
- So in that sense, it does.
- That does include the main menu - it reboots absolutely everything
  (except that the assets are all still loaded, etc.)
- It's pretty reasonable to just think of the "main menu" as its own world
 - That's what Unity and Unreal both tend to do
- Unreal also has "game modes" to help distinguish between singleplayer, multiplayer, etc.
- I don't fully understand the difference between GameMode and GameState in UE4; guess it's multiplayer related.

WorldSettings
 - Things like the "Game Mode" could be set when you load into a (particular) world
  - I.e., different worlds may have different rules / modes / systems.
