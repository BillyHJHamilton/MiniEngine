Sprites:
 - Animated sprites
 - Depth
 - Depth-sorted transparency rendering

Collisions:
 - Give collider an offset relative to the object
 - Let collider's position offset be based on a sprite's transform (including rotation)

Objects:
 - Easy object spawning
  - Could be from a factory method
  - Or a constructor
  - Or by duplicating a template object
 - Easy object copying (duplication)

Keyboard input:
 - Process keyboard input in some reasonable way
 - Allow objects or components to register events on key press

Levels:
 - More organized way to let objects register for events
 - Views, level size
 - Backgrounds - fixed or parallax
 - Allow multiple rooms / levels / worlds in the game

Components
 - Improve the wrap-around component

Game
 - Could make a game class to organize asset loading, window creation, etc.
  - Can derive from the game class to make a game for your main function.

Some more long-term goals:
 - Multithreading (task system)
 - Serialize objects to/from files (XML or equivalent)
 - Level editor
 - More static type info - e.g., find any component derived from...
