Setting up the project on Windows

1. Start VS2022 - Clone the project from Github
- The project includes the SFML-2.5.1 source

With luck, everything will work automatically.

If SFML is not working, try the following:

2. Delete the contents of MiniEngine/External/SFML-2.5.1/builds

3. Download CMake for Windows

4. Run the CMake-Gui (included with CMake)
Configure the settings as shown here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php
- You don't need to do anything with Visual Studio command line, just follow the GUI instructions
- Set the build directory to MiniEngine/External/SFML-2.5.1/builds

5. Open the SFML project that CMake generated and build it
 - Build Solution on Debug
 - Build Solution on Release
It should build, but not run (since it's just a library and has no main function)

6. Now hopefully MiniEngine will work.

You could check the paths here:
 - Under Debug:
  -> Linker / General / Additional Library Directories
  -> C/C++ / General / Additional Include Directories
 - Under Release:
  -> Same thing as for debug, but using the release directories
