This is meant to be a simple engine which combines:
 - professional style game engine design
 - GameMaker-like capabilities

Desired features:
 - Basic entity/component system
 - Objects register for events (via delegates)

Ideas for things to add
 - Collision system
  - You should register objects to join a channel, and to collide with a channel
   - A channel is identified by name.
   - If you collide with your own channel, you don't collide with yourself.
 - Movement component
  - Probably requires you to first add a position component
   - Or maybe everything already has that.
